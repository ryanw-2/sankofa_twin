# Greenhouse Thermal Twin: Predictive Simulation for Resource Optimization

## Problem Statement

This project develops a computational **digital twin** of a bamboo-framed greenhouse, simulating internal thermal dynamics based on forecasted weather and solar data.
By integrating real-time weather APIs with a physically informed heat-transfer model, the system predicts air temperature, thermal mass behavior, ventilation rates, and energy usage over the coming hours.

The goal is to **support resource-efficient greenhouse operation** by forecasting when heating, ventilation, or passive solar gain will maintain optimal growing conditions â€” before those conditions are reached.

## Motivation

Greenhouses operate in a delicate thermal balance. Over-venting wastes energy; under-venting risks plant health.
Traditional control is reactive â€” waiting until temperatures breach thresholds. This project adds a **predictive layer**, using short-term weather forecasts and thermal mass modeling to make smarter control decisions.

For growers, educators, and researchers, this enables:

* **Energy savings** via proactive control
* **Crop protection** during extreme weather
* **Educational insight** into the physics of greenhouse environments

Like an architectâ€™s 3D model, this thermal twin allows stakeholders to **experience and evaluate performance before reality**.

## Algorithmic Overview

### 1. Heat Loss Calculation

**Purpose**: Computes conductive and infiltration losses based on envelope UA values and leakage ACH.

* **Strengths**: Physics-based; scales with wind speed for infiltration.
* **Limitations**: Assumes uniform air temperature distribution.

### 2. Solar Gain Calculation

**Purpose**: Uses PVLibâ€™s irradiance models to determine incident solar on greenhouse surfaces, applying glazing transmission and SHGC.

* **Strengths**: Weather-driven and geometry-aware.
* **Limitations**: Ignores shading from nearby objects.

### 3. Thermal Mass Coupling

**Purpose**: Models energy storage and release between structural/soil mass and the air volume.

* **Strengths**: Captures dayâ€“night lag in air temperature.
* **Limitations**: Single-node mass model; no vertical stratification.

## Control Logic Walkthrough â€” `Predictive.decide`

The **`Predictive.decide`** method is the brain of the system â€” determining, hour by hour, whether the heater and vents should be engaged based on *both current conditions and the short-term forecast*.

![Algorithm Diagram](Predictive_Flowchart.png)

**Step-by-Step Process**

1. **Forecast Ingestion**
   Receives a slice of the forecast containing:

   * Outside temperature (`T_ext`)
   * Solar input (`Q_solar`)

2. **No-Heat Trajectory Prediction**

   * Simulates greenhouse air temperature for the next `H` hours assuming the heater stays **off**.
   * Uses an exponential RC model with the greenhouseâ€™s heat capacity (`C_J_K`) and conductance (`U_W_K`).
   * Solar gains are added as a direct input term.

3. **Comfort Bands and Thresholds**

   * Defines a **low band** = setpoint âˆ’ (deadband/2) âˆ’ safety margin
   * Defines a **high band** = setpoint + (deadband/2) + buffer

4. **Heating Decision**

   * If predicted temps will drop below the low band within the **lead time** (`tau`-based), enable **preheat**.
   * Apply **hysteresis**:

     * Turn on below `setpoint âˆ’ deadband/2`
     * Turn off above `setpoint + deadband/2`
   * Respect **minimum on/off timers** to prevent short-cycling.

5. **Venting Decision**

   * Calculates **temperature error** above the high band.
   * Ventilation rate is **proportional** to that error (up to `vent_max_ach`).
   * **Hot-outside guard**: reduce venting if outside is hotter than inside.
   * **Night purge**: if outside is cooler and sun is down, allow a small purge rate.
   * **Predictive warm spike**: if the no-heat forecast shows overheating soon, ramp vents early.

6. **Outputs**
   Returns:

   * `heater_on` (bool)
   * `part_load` (fractional heater output; currently 0 or 1)
   * `vent_ach` (active air changes per hour)

**Example Flow**

* **Early morning**: Forecast shows temps dipping below setpoint â†’ preheat kicks in before drop occurs.
* **Midday sun**: Interior warms past comfort â†’ vents open proportionally, reduced if outside hotter.
* **Evening**: Sun sets, outside cools â†’ small night purge to remove excess heat.

## Modular Simulation Design

The system is implemented as a **modular pipeline**, allowing each physical process to be tuned independently:

* Weather & solar data retrieval (`forecast.py`)
* Thermal mass modeling (`ThermalMass.py`)
* Heat transfer calculations (`GreenhouseThermalEngine`)
* Predictive decision logic (`Predictive`)
* Frontend dashboard (`streamlit_app.py`)

This separation allows easy swapping of control algorithms or testing different physical assumptions.
